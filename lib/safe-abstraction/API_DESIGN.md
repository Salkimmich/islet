# API DESIGN

This crate utilizes closures to provide Safe Abstraction.

Using closures to abstract `unsafe` code presents
a powerful method in Rust for balancing safety with functionality.
However, when implementing this method,
it's important to consider performance, safety verification,
and the complexity introduced by the abstraction.
A well-designed library can be a valuable resource in the Rust community,
significantly easing the burden of managing `unsafe` code.

## Closures Advantages

1. **Enhanced Safety in Client Code**:
By avoiding direct usage of `unsafe` code in client implementations,
the risk of unintended memory safety violations is reduced.
This leverages Rust’s safety features to their full extent.

2. **Improved Code Reusability**:
Abstracting `unsafe` code into reusable interfaces
can reduce code duplication across areas
that require similar `unsafe` operations,
enhancing the maintainability of the codebase.

3. **Maintained Analysis at the MIR Stage**:
As the `unsafe` code still exists within the library,
the Rust compiler can perform analyses at the MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation) stage,
optimizing the code and identifying potential safety issues.

## Closures Considerations

1. **Complexity of Abstraction**:
Abstracting `unsafe` code introduces complexity.
Designing an interface that sufficiently
hides the intricacies of `unsafe` operations
while remaining user-friendly requires careful consideration.

2. **Performance Considerations**:
The impact of using closures for abstraction
on runtime performance should be evaluated.
It’s crucial to ensure that the introduction of
closures does not introduce significant overhead.

3. **Formal Verification**:
Using closures to abstract `unsafe` code can make formal verification
more challenging due to the anonymous nature of closures and their capturing behavior.
Formal verification is the process of mathematically proving
that code satisfies certain safety properties.
This process requires a clear understanding of the code's structure and behavior,
which can be complicated by closures

4. **Restricting Return Type**:
Without restricting return type,
considering that we need to address potential issues
from the perspectives of API Misuse and Breaking Encapsulation.

## Formal Verification Aspects of Closures

1. **Anonymity**:
Closures are similar to nameless functions,
often used for short blocks of code.
This makes referencing or analyzing the body of a closure more complex than with named functions.

2. **Capturing Behavior**:
Closures can capture variables from their enclosing scope, either by value or by reference.
This means the behavior of the closure is dependent on the state of these captured variables,
requiring analysis of the state and lifecycle of these variables to fully understand the closure's behavior.

3. **Interaction with Higher-order Functions**:
Closures are frequently used as arguments to higher-order functions.
This interaction can complicate the inference of the closure's behavior,
as the way the higher-order function invokes the closure can alter its behavior.

These characteristics reflect the dynamic nature of code that uses closures.
This dynamic nature can complicate formal verification efforts,
as modeling and reasoning about the behavior of code become more challenging.
If formal verification tools or techniques are not designed to adequately handle the anonymity
and dynamic capturing behavior of closures,
using these tools to verify the safety of `unsafe` code could become more complex.

Therefore, when designing a library to abstract `unsafe` code,
it’s important to consider these points to ensure that
the library facilitates formal verification,
possibly by opting for explicit functions over closures
or by clearly documenting the behavior of closures.

## Macros as an Alternative to Closures for Facilitating Formal Verification

Using a macro to abstract `unsafe` operations instead of closures offers
a different set of trade-offs that can be particularly advantageous in certain contexts.

Since macros expand into concrete code at compile time,
they don't inherently obscure the code's structure and
flow in the same way closures might.

This characteristic can make formal verification efforts more straightforward
because the expanded code remains subject to the same analysis
and verification techniques as hand-written code.

## Macros Considerations

1. **Complexity of Macro Rules**:
Writing macros, especially those that abstract complex `unsafe` operations, can be challenging.
Macro rules need to be carefully crafted
to ensure they correctly capture the intended patterns
and apply the abstraction without introducing errors.

2. **Debugging Difficulty**:
Debugging macro-expanded code can be more difficult than
debugging regular code or closures.
The code generated by macro expansion might not directly map
to the source code written by developers, complicating the debugging process.

## Conclusion

Offering both closures and macros as options
for abstracting `unsafe` code can provide
Rust developers with the flexibility to choose the approach
that best suits their needs and the specific context of their code.

While closures offer encapsulation and the ability to capture surrounding context,
macros provide explicitness, ease of formal verification,
and the ability to abstract repetitive patterns.

The choice between using closures and macros should be guided
by the specific requirements of the project,
including considerations for safety, readability, and ease of maintenance and verification.
