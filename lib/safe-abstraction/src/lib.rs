//! # Safe Abstraction Crate
//!
//! The `safe_abstraction` crate is a library designed
//! to facilitate safer abstraction over `unsafe` code.
//!
//! Its primary goal is to enhance the safety of `unsafe` code
//! by providing data structures and functions that minimize
//! the need for direct `unsafe` code usage,
//! and by offering traits for automating
//! and explicitly marking parts of `unsafe` code
//! that require developer intervention.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Encapsulation of Unsafe Code**: Offers a way to safely abstract `unsafe` operations,
//! allowing for lower-level operations like memory access to be performed more safely.
//!
//! - **Runtime Safety Checks**: Provides methods to perform crucial safety checks at runtime,
//! such as verifying if a pointer is null and checking whether a pointer is properly aligned.
//! These checks happen when the methods are called during the execution of a program.
//!
//! - **Compile-Time Type Safety Checks**: Enforces certain safety guarantees at compile time.
//! For example, the use of Rust's type system can ensure that only pointers
//! to types with known sizes are used, leveraging the `Sized` trait bound.
//!
//! - **Developer-Driven Safety Verification**: Introduces traits that allow developers
//! to explicitly mark parts of `unsafe` code that still require manual safety guarantees,
//! making it clear which parts of the code need careful review.

    //! # Raw Pointer Safety Abstraction Module
    //!
    //! This module provides a set of traits designed
    //! to facilitate safe abstraction over raw pointers.
    //!
    //! Raw pointers (`*const T` and `*mut T`) offer great power
    //! but come with great responsibility: they are unsafe by nature
    //! and require careful handling to ensure safety.
    //!
    //! The `raw_ptr` module introduces traits
    //! that enforce checks on raw pointers
    //! to ensure that their usage adheres
    //! to Rustâ€™s safety guarantees.
    //!
    //! ## Traits Overview
    //! - `RawPtr`: Ensures that the size of the structure
    //! pointed to by the raw pointer is determined at compile time,
    //! enabling safe memory operations.
    //!
    //! - `SafetyChecked`: Implements checks to ensure that the raw pointer is not null,
    //! properly aligned, and has the appropriate permissions for the intended memory operation.
    //!
    //! - `SafetyAssured`: Provides guarantees that the instance
    //! pointed to by the raw pointer is properly initialized,
    //! adheres to Rust's lifetime rules, and respects Rust's ownership rules.
    //!
    //! ## Safety Rules Checked
    //! 1. **Compile-time Size Determination**:
    //! The size of the structure the raw pointer points
    //! to must be determined at compile time,
    //! ensuring that memory operations are safe and predictable.
    //!
    //! 2. **Non-null**: The raw pointer must not be null,
    //! preventing dereference of null pointers
    //!
    //! 3. **Proper Alignment**: The address contained in the raw pointer must be properly aligned,
    //! ensuring that the memory access respects the hardware's alignment requirements.
    //!
    //! 4. **Appropriate Permissions**: The raw pointer must have the appropriate permissions
    //! for the operation, such as read, write, or execute permissions.
    //!
    //! 5. **Initialization**: The instance pointed to by the raw pointer must be guaranteed
    //! to be properly initialized, avoiding undefined behavior due to uninitialized memory access.
    //!
    //! 6. **Lifetime Rules Compliance**: The instance pointed to by the raw pointer
    //! must comply with Rust's lifetime rules, ensuring that it does not outlive its scope.
    //!
    //! 7. **Ownership Rules Compliance**: The instance pointed to by the raw pointer
    //! must comply with Rust's ownership rules, preventing data races and ensuring safe memory access.
    //!
    //! By adhering to these safety rules
    //! through the implementation of the `RawPtr`, `SafetyChecked`, and `SafetyAssured` traits,
    //! developers can leverage the power of raw pointers in Rust
    //! while ensuring safety and adhering to the language's strict safety guarantees.
    //!
    //! Once these traits have been implemented, access to the target instance can be made through
    //! the `SafetyAssumed` structure, allowing interaction with the instance using only safe code.
    //! It emphasizes that by adhering to the safety rules and
    //! utilizing the `SafetyAssumed` structure, developers can maintain safety guarantees
    //! while interacting with potentially unsafe sources or operations.
